<p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://you.stonybrook.edu/thornelab/">Dr. Lesley Thorneâ€™s Lab</a> at Stony Brook University in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. I obtained my B.Sc. in Environment from McGill University and my Master of Science in Marine Science in 2017 in the Thorne Lab. My masterâ€™s research focused on spatial and temporal patterns in overlap between short-finned pilot whales, pelagic longlines, and pilot whale bycatch records in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. My dissertation research is centered around the predator-prey relationship between large whales (primarily humpback and fin whales) and their prey in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and specifically the New York Bight, and how the predator-prey relationship informs large whale distributions in a highly urbanized environment.</p>

<p>My research interests are motivated by the conflict, resolution, and passion that is derived from the coexistence of marine megafauna and humans. To better address these conflicts, I am developing the skills needed to assist, create, and eventually lead in the translation of complex data-enabled research into informed decisions and sound policies through the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/stride/">Stony Brook STRIDE program</a> and fellowship. When Iâ€™m not in the field or troubleshooting code, Iâ€™m often running, figure skating, or baking sourdough bread.</p>
