<p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://you.stonybrook.edu/thornelab/">Dr. Lesley Thorne’s Lab</a> at Stony Brook University in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. I obtained my B.Sc. in Environment from McGill University and my Master of Science in Marine Science in 2017 in the Thorne Lab. My master’s research focused on spatial and temporal patterns in overlap between short-finned pilot whales, pelagic longlines, and pilot whale bycatch records in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. My dissertation research is centered around the predator-prey relationship between large whales (primarily humpback and fin whales) and their prey in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and specifically the New York Bight, and how the predator-prey relationship informs large whale distributions in a highly urbanized environment.</p>

<p>My research interests are motivated by the conflict, resolution, and passion that is derived from the coexistence of marine megafauna and humans. To better address these conflicts, I am developing the skills needed to assist, create, and eventually lead in the translation of complex data-enabled research into informed decisions and sound policies through the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/stride/">Stony Brook STRIDE program</a> and fellowship. When I’m not in the field or troubleshooting code, I’m often running, figure skating, or baking sourdough bread.</p>
