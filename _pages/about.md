I am a PhD student in the [Dr. Lesley Thorne's Lab](https://you.stonybrook.edu/thornelab/) at Stony Brook University in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. I obtained my B.Sc. in Environment from McGill University and my Master of Science in Marine Science in 2017 in the Thorne Lab. My masterâ€™s research focused on spatial and temporal patterns in overlap between short-finned pilot whales, pelagic longlines, and pilot whale bycatch records in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. My dissertation research is centered around the predator-prey relationship between large whales (primarily humpback and fin whales) and their prey in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and specifically the New York Bight, and how the predator-prey relationship informs large whale distributions in a highly urbanized environment. 

My research interests are motivated by the conflict, resolution, and passion that is derived from the coexistence of marine megafauna and humans. To better address these conflicts, I am developing the skills needed to assist, create, and eventually lead in the translation of complex data-enabled research into informed decisions and sound policies through the [Stony Brook STRIDE program](https://www.stonybrook.edu/stride/) and fellowship. When I'm not in the field or troubleshooting code, I'm often running, figure skating, or baking sourdough bread.
